# The Em_project

Takes logs of users having access to uploaded contents on a webpage. An email is sent to the admin and a log is recorded by the system in the database.

## How it works?

  1. User logs on to the system [Through the webpage].
  2. Users accesses the uploaded contents by a click.
  3. The system alerts the Admin of every access via an automated email.
  4. The database takes a log of every access and sorts them into their respective tables.
